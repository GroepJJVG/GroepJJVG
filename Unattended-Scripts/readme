These unattended scripts may look weird in it's namegiving as I call them Power.

Power is just in fact the amount of things they do. With Power 0 being the lowest basically doing nothing and Power 3 being in this case the highest.

They represent the 4 periods of the year in the schoolyear and have it's focus on ADDS, DNS and DHCP. 

All scripts except Power 0 will have a transcript in case something will go wrong we can look at it and we can see what the error was that was given and can then fix it.

The scripts have been tested on a test environment and seemed to be working just fine.
